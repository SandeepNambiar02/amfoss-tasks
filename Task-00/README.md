## How did i download Ubuntu?
I downloaded ubuntu using the Virtual Box. Since this is my new precious laptop, i don't want to risk of losing my data in case something goes wrong while dual-booting as i heard many had experienced some problem while dual booting their device.

## Errors and Mistakes
Technically, i didn't experience any errors or do any any mistakes. It works perfectly.
