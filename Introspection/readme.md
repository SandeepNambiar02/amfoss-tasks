# Introspection


### Why we must choose you?

First of all, i love the way coding works. With coding we can create, bulid and most of all learn many new things from it. All we need is just a basic idea and a motivation to work for it.This was the main reason i wanted to learn coding. But to be honest, i'm very weak in computer science. But i have some fair knowledge in C++ (not much though) since i took CS in my +1 and +2. I'm not a physically active or socially active kind of person but i have lot of caring and loving friends. Also, i'm very interested to try and learn new things and then to work them out and i think joining amFoss seems to be the ideal place for me to increase my knowledge and skill in these things.


### What is your plan for the next 6 months?

For the next 6 months, my plan is to try and do some innovative projects and also side by side to focus on my studies to create a good base so as to maintain a good CGPA.


### How would you contribute back to the club?

I will contribute as much as i can and would also help people who wish to join the club with their tasks and problems.


### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

By looking into the tasks, some of them are a bit challenging. I guess, for a person coming from other streams such as Bio-Maths, the tasks can be very challenging. My suggestion would be that the selection council should first look into each individual's personal knowledge in the subject and then assign task to them.
