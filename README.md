## About my tasks

I would say that the most of the tasks were pretty much tricky and difficult to do and as a matter of fact i was not able to complete all the tasks. After reading through the tasks i realised that there is so much more learn and explore in the field of computer science that i didn't know about. Though i was not able to finish the tasks, i learned how to start learning a new language and approach new problems and several ways to overcome the errors, mostly using effective Googling.The tasks made my interest in this field a little more higher but i feel disheartened due to the fact that i was not able to complete all the tasks.

## Who's me
I was born in Trivandrum but was brought up in Ernakulam. The reason why i joined Amrita is because of its popularity and vast exposure the institute is providing to the students and also the **placements**. I heard a lot about the various Clubs and i thought this would be my best option for my computer science degree. I have no experience in this field ,though i learned C++ in my higher secondary but other than that nothing at all which why i want to learn many new things from the club and which in my opinion i thought amfoss would be the ideal place for it.
