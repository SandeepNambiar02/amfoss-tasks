Rust was a very different language for me when compared to C++ and python. I was not able to fully complete the task as i could only just web-scrape the total cases, total deaths, and total recovered in the world rather than web-scraping the information about 10 most covid affected countries from <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries">Worldometers.info</a>.
